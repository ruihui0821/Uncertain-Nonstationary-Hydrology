# UncertainNonstationaryHydrology

I. Using log-normal distribution for annual peak flood flow curve, a climate scenario is represented by a linearly chaing mean and linearly changing standard deviation of annual peak flood flow.

I.1. DP: Dynamic Programming for Stationary Hydrology, would be run for different climate scenarios (mean annual peak flow) separately

I.2. SDP: Stochastic Dynamic Programming for Certain Nonstationary hydrology, run for a series of certain climate scenarios

I.3. SDPMP: Stochastic Dynamic Programming with Markov Process for Uncertain Nonstationary hydrology, run for a series of uncertain climate scenarios, conditional probability is updated using Baye's Theorem.





II. Using normal distribution for annual peak flood flow curve, and only take mean annual peak flow as changing parameter for a climate scenario

II.1. DP_normal: Dynamic Programming for Stationary Hydrology, would be run for different climate scenarios (mean annual peak flow) separately

II.2. SDP_normal: Stochastic Dynamic Programming for Certain Nonstationary hydrology, run for a series of certain climate scenarios

II.3. SDPMP_normal: Stochastic Dynamic Programming with Markov Process for Uncertain Nonstationary hydrology, run for a series of uncertain climate scenarios, conditional probability is updated using Baye's Theorem.
