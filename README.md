# UncertainNonstationaryHydrology

DP: Dynamic Programming for Stationary Hydrology, would be run for different climate scenarios (mean annual peak flow) separately

SDP: Stochastic Dynamic Programming for Certain Nonstationary hydrology, run for a series of certain climate scenarios

SDPMP: Stochastic Dynamic Programming with Markov Process for Uncertain Nonstationary hydrology, run for a series of uncertain climate scenarios, conditional probability is updated using Baye's Theorem.
